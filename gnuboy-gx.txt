-=[ INTRODUCTION ]=-
 
GnuboyGX is a port for the Nintendo Gamecube and Nintendo Wii (running in GC mode)
of the open-source Gnuboy emulator, originally coded by Laguna and Gilgamesh.
More infos about Gnuboy here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnuboy

This port is based on the last 1.0.4 CVS source, released by Joshua_ from EFNet #gameboy
http://www.netaxs.com/~gevaryah/gnuboy-1.0.4pre.tar.bz2.

This has nothing to do with the previous GX port for GCLinux, this is a full standalone
port using LibOGC API (GX, Audio, Inputs...)
See changelog.txt for the whole history.

-=[ USER NOTES ]=-

* gnuboy_cube.dol is the Gamecube version of this program. You only need to load and run
this DOL on your GC or WII (in GC compatibility mode) using various methods (Bootable DVD, SDLOAD,...)
If you have no idea on how to load&run a DOL, please go here on follow the available guides:
http://modyawii.tehskeen.com/  (Booting Homebrew Section)

* gnuboy_wii.dol is the Wii version of the program. It has been compiled to work in Wii mode, featuring extra feature
such as Wiimote/Nunchuk & Classic controller support. To run this on your Wii, you will need to install the
Homebrew Channel (http://hbc.hackmii.com/). Once installed, rename gnuboy_wii.dol as boot.dol and copy this file on your sdcard,
in /apps/gnuboy for example. Icon.png and meta.xml should also be placed in the same directory.


ROMS can be loaded from a SDCARD, either through a SD-adapter in MCARD slot (Gamecube version only), or through the 
native Wii SD slot (WIi version only). ROMS must be copied on your SDCARD in the following directory: /gnuboy/roms

ROMS can also be loaded from a ISO9660 DVD. A modchip is required in gameCube mode. On teh Wii, no modchip is required but you will
need to install the DI Stub before you can access DVD-/+R. More infos on HackMii: http://hackmii.com/2008/08/libdi-and-the-dvdx-installer/
The maximal readable size is 1.35GB on Gamecube and 4.7GB on Wii (in GC compatible mode).


IMPORTANT: When putting roms either on DVD or SDCARD, it is recommended to use subdirectories as there is 
	   a limit of 1000 files per directory.

-=[ DEV NOTES ]=-

According to the GNU status of this project, the source code MUST be made available to anyone as soon
as you have modified it and released a binary. 
To recompile the source code, you will need to be familiar with development environment setup.
If you don't, you might look at wiibrew or tehskeen's forum. 

First, you will have to download and install the following tools/libraries: 
1.	the last version of Devkitpro and DevkitPPC. Windows user should directly run the AutoInstaller version 
2.	the CVS version of libogc. 
3.	the last version of libfat.
You can also get and compile the current source from CVS repository 
4.	the last libDI source code. 

Once you are done, grab the current gnuboy-gx source code from SVN (http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy-gx/source/checkout)
then launch compile_all.bat from msys (installed with devkitpro)
