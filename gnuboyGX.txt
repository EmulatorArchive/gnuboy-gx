-=[ INTRODUCTION ]=-
 
GnuboyGX is a port for the Nintendo Gamecube and Nintendo Wii (running in GC mode)
of the open-source Gnuboy emulator, originally coded by Laguna and Gilgamesh.
More infos about Gnuboy here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnuboy

This port is based on the last 1.0.4 CVS source, released by Joshua_ from EFNet #gameboy
http://www.netaxs.com/~gevaryah/gnuboy-1.0.4pre.tar.bz2.

This has nothing to do with the previous GX port for GCLinux, this is a full standalone
port using LibOGC API (GX, Audio, Inputs...)
See changelog.txt for the whole history.

-=[ USER NOTES ]=-

The emulator is provided as a .dol which is a Gamecube Executable. You only need to load and run
the DOL on your GC or WII (Gamecube Pad needed) using various methods (Bootable DVD, SDLOAD,...)
If you have no idea on how to load&run a DOL, please go here on follow the available guides:
http://modyawii.tehskeen.com/  (Booting Homebrew Section)

SDCARD users should create a directory named "gnuboy" at the root of the SDCARD.
Inside this directory, you have to create then a subdirectory named "roms" to put all your roms.
You should also create a subdirectory named "saves" where SRAM and FreezeState files will be saved.

If using a DVD to load the roms, the format of the image you burned must be ISO9960
or you won't be able to read from it. The maximal readable size is 1.35GB for Gamecube users
and 4.7GB for Wii users.

IMPORTANT: When putting roms either on DVD or SDCARD, it is recommended to use subdirectories as there is 
	   a limit of 1000 files per directory.

    coordinate when in DMG (Mono GB) mode.

  NOTE: The configuration file can only be saved to SDCARD in SLOTA
